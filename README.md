## Overview

This simple calendar application allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML, CSS powered by jQuery, and utilize the Luxon library to work with dates and times. 


## Why

```
As a busy student with a lot on thier plate, I found myself forgetting important things because they weren't written down. I needed something that could record what I had to do for the day to keep me on track, that would save what I wrote, and at a glance, tell me if I was ahead behind or on track with my agenda.
